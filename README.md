# CNA TLR & Root Compact List
A low-calorie, unofficial view of the CNA list, hosted at https://todb.github.io/CNAs/ .

This is a quickie parsing of the current CNA list, broken out by Top-Level Root (TLR), then by Root. Currently, there's only two top-level roots,
the MITRE Corporation and CISA. But, if you see a third here, that means there's a new TLR, or more likely, a typo in one of the existing ones.

This list pulls directly from https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-website/tree/dev/src/assets/data, but
this website is quite definitely an unofficial, probably error-prone parsing of that data.

If you notice any bugs, you should report those to https://github.com/todb/CNAs.
